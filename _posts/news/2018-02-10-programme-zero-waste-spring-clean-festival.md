We just released the program for our Zero Waste Spring Clean Festival that will take place on February 25 at the ABC Drumcondra.

Spring is here, which calls for a spring clean. The theme for this Festival is ‘spring cleaning’. So whether you are looking to minimize your impact when it comes to all things clean or give your wardrobe a minimalist makeover, there is something for everyone.
Zero Waste Festival’s aim is to bring people together, to share experiences and advice. There will be a market where everyone can top up their supplies and buy eco cleaning products for the year ahead. There will be talks and workshops throughout the day on topics from detoxing your relationship with stuff to just detoxing your cleaning routine. As Spring is the time for planting, we will have experts on hand for gardening advice among others at our info stands. If you have cleaned out your wardrobe, you can drop in any clean, good quality clothes to our swap-shop and use your tokens guilt-free! 
The Zero Waste movement is about minimising your impact on the environment by reducing your contribution to landfill. Often described as a journey, it is based around 5 R’s (Refuse, Reduce, Reuse, Recycle and Rot/Compost). The Zero Waste Festival itself is aimed at people at any stage of their Zero Waste journey. 

Access to the market and swap-shop is free and is buggy and wheelchair accessible. A day-long pass for workshops and talks can be bought on [Eventbrite](https://www.eventbrite.ie/e/workshop-talk-pass-for-zero-waste-spring-clean-festival-tickets-42846506053) for €10. Spaces are limited and we cannot guarantee availability of tickets. The pass entitles you to entry into as many workshops as you like on the day, but you must sign up in advance on the day.
