Jan is an environmental scientist with an undeniable passion for sustainability, data, more data, and quirky facts. E.g., did you know that only 9% of all plastic ever produced actually was recycled? So, better to ditch the disposables! Jan mainly takes care of our website and you might see him shoot a few videos and click a picture or two during our events. He was the project manager for our largest Festival to date at the Science Gallery. You can also find him on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/JanKnappe) or check out his personal [blog](https://www.janknappe.com).
