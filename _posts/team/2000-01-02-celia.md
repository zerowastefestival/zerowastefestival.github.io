Celia has been involved with the Zero Waste Festival team from the beginning and is heading our pop-up events. Together with Mies, she also runs the [Zero Waste Dublin Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Zero-waste-meetup-ireland/), is a member of the [Dublin CSA](https://csadublin.wordpress.com/) (Community Supported Agriculture), and co-founder of [Precious Plastic Dublin](https://www.preciousplasticdublin.org/). You can follow her Zero Waste adventures on her [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/zerowaste.adventures/) and her own [blog](http://celiasomlai.com/). Her biggest enemy is disposable plastic and her favourite zero waste gadget is a jam jar. In "real life", she is researching [packaging waste in Ireland and the EU](http://rewrapped.ucd.ie/).
