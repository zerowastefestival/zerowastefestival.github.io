Zdenka is a food lover and amateur aerial acrobat who likes to keep things simple. She shares her tips and tricks for living a more sustainable life on her blog, [Coming to Zero](https://comingtozero.com/){:target="_blank"}.  In her free time, youâ€™ll find her in the garden trying to coax vegetables out of the ground by any wizardry possible. She has also occasionally been sighted indoors, but is likely to cut a distorted figure behind all those glass jars full of kitchen experiments. Zdenka joined the festival organisation team in July 2017 and currently is the treasurer, instagrammer and (wannabe) designer.
