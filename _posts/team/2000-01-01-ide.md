Íde is a true sustainarian and founding mother of the Zero Waste Festival. Her journey towards living more sustainably started back in 2016, which she declared to be her personal buy-nothing-new-year. Since, she graduated to be a renowned [Zero Waste lifestyle expert](https://www.tipperarylive.ie/news/home/307930/lifestyle-expert-to-visit-cashel.html). In 2017, with her husband, she started the first Zero Waste stall touring the markets of Dublin and its surroundings (Bring your Own). On Instagram, you can follow Íde‘s [eco journal](https://www.instagram.com/itseasyifyouwantto/) documenting her efforts to reduce her impact on the planet.
