#### 11:00 am - Campaigning for Zero Waste (talk)

![Elaine Butler]({{ site.url }}/images/2017-06-01/elaine.jpg "Elaine Butler"){:style="float: top;margin-right: 10px;height: 150px;"}<br>
We will be looking at policy decisions that have resulted in such an excess of waste, the changes needed to move us towards Zero Waste and how each of us can lobby and campaign for this change. **Elaine Butler** managed policy development in the Green Party from 2013 to 2017. She is now the National Coordinator in the party and is involved in Grassroots campaigns to get rid of disposable plastic cups, packaging of fruit and veg in supermarkets and bring back deposits on bottles.


#### 12:00 am - The Devil Wears Primark, Fast Fashion and Waste in the Garment Industry (talk)

![Emma Gleeson]({{ site.url }}/images/2017-06-01/emma.jpg "Emma Gleeson"){:style="float: top;margin-right: 10px;height: 150px;"}<br>
**Emma Gleeson** has an MA in Fashion Sustainability and has worked in the arts sector for the past 10 years. Her dissertation investigated the harmful psychological effects of over consumption which inspired her to establish her own personal decluttering, Give Up Yer Aul Tings. She hopes to help her clients free themselves from clutter and realise that consuming less can make us lighter, more productive and generally happier. 

#### 1:00 pm - A Quest for Meaning (film screening)

*A Quest for Meaning* is the story of two childhood friends who meet again after 10 years. Marc exports bottled water from New York whereas Nathanaël works in water collective management. After the 2008 economic crisis and a documentary therapy, Marc realizes that he is also a part of the problem. To understand where the system’s predatory logic comes from and seek food for thought and solutions, they will go and meet those who are building the world of tomorrow. This adventure will cast doubt on all their founding principles and beliefs as well as ours.

#### 3:00 pm - Ask a Zero Waste Question (Q&A)

We have selected a panel with varying backgrounds and experiences who will be able to answer your zero waste related questions on everything from cleaning your house and navigating social situations to getting your community involved.

![Íde Mhic Gabhann]({{ site.url }}/images/2017-06-01/ide.jpg "Íde Mhic Gabhann"){:style="float: top;margin-right: 10px;height: 150px;"}<br>
**Íde Mhic Gabhann** loves travelling and has seen the effect of waste on the world as well as experience cultures that are quite happily doing without the "essentials" we use. Despite this she has led a very wasteful life and is only in the last year and a half began to cut out packaging, turn more to second hand products and sustainable materials as well as reducing the volume of possessions sitting around her house. When she became frustrated with not being able to buy everything she could loose, she set up [Bring Your Own](https://www.facebook.com/bringyourowncontainers/), a market stall selling loose dry goods, to give an opportunity to other people like her to be able to shop package free.

![Mindy O’Brien]({{ site.url }}/images/2017-06-01/mindy.jpg "Mindy O’Brien"){:style="float: top;margin-right: 10px;height: 150px;"}<br>
**Mindy O’Brien** is the Coordinator at [VOICE of Irish Concern for the Environment](http://voiceireland.org/). She is an environmental attorney and has been actively involved in environmental issues for nearly 25 years. Most recently, she has been campaigning for proactive actions to reduce food waste and promote sustainable consumption. Mindy has developed a [Towards Zero Waste, Cashel](http://voiceireland.org/waste/launch-cashel/) pilot programme, which commenced early 2017. 

![Laura Cahill]({{ site.url }}/images/2017-06-01/laura.jpg "Laura Cahill"){:style="float: top;margin-right: 10px;height: 150px;"}<br>
**Laura Cahill** is a born minimalist, which lead her to zero waste. Laura and her husband have been working or reducing their household waste since 2003. Their zero-waste lifestyle helped herself and her husband financially to change careers, and their family to lead lives based on experiences instead of stuff.
Laura also helps individuals and families declutter their homes and gives advice on the practicalities of reducing household waste. Earlier this year, she invited [Bèa Johnson](https://zerowastehome.com/), founder of the worldwide zero waste movement, to Dublin, and organised Bèa's successful talk at Trinity College Dublin.


#### 4:00 pm - The Clean Bin Project (film screening)

Is it possible to live completely waste free? In this multi-award winning, festival favourite, partners Jen and Grant go head to head in a competition to see who can swear off consumerism and produce the least garbage. Their light-hearted competition is set against a darker examination of the problem waste. Even as Grant and Jen start to garner interest in their project, they struggle to find meaning in their minuscule influence on the large-scale environmental impacts of our “throw-away society”.
