## What is the Waste Action Plan?

The [Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment](https://www.dccae.gov.ie/en-ie/environment/consultations/Pages/Public-Consultation-Waste-Action-Plan-for-a-Circular-Economy.aspx) is seeking views on the development of a new [Waste Action Plan for Ireland](https://www.dccae.gov.ie/en-ie/environment/consultations/Documents/26/consultations/Waste_Action_Plan_for_a_Circular_Economy.pdf) as part of the move to a more Circular Economy where resources are kept in use for as long as possible and then recycled or reused at the end of their service life. 

This consultation will enable Ireland to develop a new waste policy/circular economy plan to meet the emerging challenges and build on the targets set out in the [Climate Action Plan](https://www.dccae.gov.ie/en-ie/climate-action/publications/Pages/Climate-Action-Plan.aspx). 

## How can I make a submission?

On February 10, we held a [Panel Discussion on the Waste Action Plan
](/pop-up/zero-waste-pop-up-waste-action-plan/) at Trinity College Dublin and discussed the proposed plan among five panellists and the public. As a result of this discussion we put together a [draft submission](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1X0uvPqnkmTIFsgeWHgKM4jleZaCusY8zn17qO8RTEXc/edit?usp=sharing) that you can download here.

To help you with making a submissions, the document is divided into themed areas according to the [Waste Action Plan](https://www.dccae.gov.ie/en-ie/environment/consultations/Documents/26/consultations/Waste_Action_Plan_for_a_Circular_Economy.pdf). We also collated a [separate document that lists all the questions](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WMy5pKWaBZUOhZyhLv7I_ARtSQMo-93Lo8UI0OoBcTo/edit?usp=sharing) discussed in the plan if you wish to address questions we did not get to discussion with the panel. Feel free to add to the draft or remove things as you see fit. It should be your personal opinion and experience that counts.

Here is how to download the document from Google Docs:
