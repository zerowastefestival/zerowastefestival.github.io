The Irish Times put together a handy A to Z guide on how to cut down on plastics at home. 

Check out this informative piece and follow along the journey that led Íde Mhic Gabhann and  Molly Aylesbury - both are fellow Zero Waste Festival Ireland organisers - to open up their own zero waste businesses [Bring Your Own](https://www.facebook.com/bringyourowncontainers/) and [Bare Necessities](https://www.facebook.com/BareNecessitiesIreland/). 

You can read the full article from A for *alternatives* to Z for *zooplankton* on the [Irish Times website here](https://www.irishtimes.com/life-and-style/homes-and-property/interiors/waste-not-a-z-guide-to-cutting-down-on-plastics-in-the-home-1.3393338).
