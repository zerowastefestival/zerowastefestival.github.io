![Zero Waste Week Panel Discussion: How to Stay Positive in Challenging Times](/events/2020-week-september/ZWW FB Panel Discussion.jpg)

The current global pandemic has caused much upheaval in most of our lives. For many of us we haven’t been able to be as sustainable as we would like due to personal circumstances, access to facilities, external guidelines as well as having to prioritise in our lives.
In this panel discussion we speak to a diverse range of zero wasters on how they are coping, the compromises they are making and tips they have to keep positive in these times.
We welcome questions to put to the panel submitted in advance to info@zerowastefestival.ie or a limited number in real time through the zoom chat function.

The panel will be hosted by Brian Mac Muiris, a former Botanist and Environmental Consultant. I have been interested in the environment for over 20 years.  In 2018 i got involved in Zero Waste Movement when i arranged one of the first plastic bottle free charity runs in Dublin. Followed then by becoming a member of Zero Festival Ireland

With panelists Elaine Butler, Fionn Ó hAlmhain and Laura Cahill.

Elaine Butler publishes the sustainable living guide  Living Lightly in Ireland. This website has all the information you need to live more sustainably in Ireland; from where to shop, to what to cook. In order to maintain objectivity she doesn't do sponsored posts and the website is funded by readers. As well as being a mum and a wife she's a designer, and is currently studying for a Masters in Product Design for the Circular Economy in NCAD, which is being funded by the Ellen MacArthur Foundation.

Fionn is a trad musician and opera singer. His zero waste experience went from preferentially choosing reusables and better quality products made to last, to switching to plastic free toiletries, and now is at the stage where he cycles one direction to get his package free direct from the roaster coffee beans and the opposite to pick up his rice in a jar.

Laura Cahill is a minimalist who has been practicing ‘zero waste’ living with her husband and children for over 15 years. Laura is a full time relationship counsellor who also gives talks on eco anxiety,  on the practicalities of reducing household waste and on the psychological benefits of simplicity and zero waste. In 2017 Laura invited Bèa Johnson, founder of the worldwide zero waste movement, to Dublin and organised her successful talk at Trinity College Dublin. Laura has been interviewed by numerous media outlets in Ireland and abroad, and gave an interview on the Ray D’Arcy show just before the Covid-19 pandemic.
