Get your Zero Waste Week off to a good start and find out what Zero Waste is, meet new people, ask questions or share tips.

Are you interested in finding out more about Zero Waste living in Dublin? Are you not sure where to start your own Zero Waste journey? Are you an expert on local Zero Waste hacks? Do you want to rant or give tips about Zero Waste? Or do you just want to meet like-minded people? Whatever your answers are to these questions, come join us for a chat in the park.
Feel free to bring your own snacks or dinner, preferably in reusable containers.

We'll be adhering to all HSE guidelines on social distancing. Please RSVP on [Eventbrite](https://zww-meetup.eventbrite.ie) to secure a place. Also see our [Meetup.com event](https://www.meetup.com/Zero-waste-meetup-ireland/events/272867776/).

This event is free! We generally meet every first Monday of the month. The location might vary in the future, so please always double check.
