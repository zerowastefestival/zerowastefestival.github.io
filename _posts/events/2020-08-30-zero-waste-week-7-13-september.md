Our annual events for Zero Waste Week are back from September 7th to 13th 2020. This year, in order to comply with government guidelines and keep everyone safe, we are unable to run some of the events we planned, others will have very limited capacity and some have been moved online. Although this will be a smaller than usual festival week, we hope that our usual elements of information, education, a sense of community, and personal empowerment will shine through.
