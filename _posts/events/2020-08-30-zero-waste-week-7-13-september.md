*Zero Waste Festival Ireland brings you annual Zero Waste Week Events*

Our annual events for Zero Waste Week are back from September 7th to 13th 2020. This year, in order to comply with government guidelines and keep everyone safe, we are unable to run some of the events we planned, others will have very limited capacity and some have been moved online. Although this will be a smaller than usual festival week, we hope that our usual elements of information, education, a sense of community, and personal empowerment will shine through.

The week starts with our usual monthly meet-up, on Monday 7th at 6pm in Merrion Square. So if you are interested in finding out more about zero waste living in Dublin, if you are not sure where to start your own zero waste journey, you are an expert on local Zero Waste hacks and want to share your tip or you want to rant or give tips about Zero Waste? If it’s any of the above or you just want to meet like-minded people, come join us for a chat in the park. Feel free to bring your own snacks or dinner, preferably in reusable containers!  Following the government guidelines, there are limited places, so secure your place on https://zww-meetup.eventbrite.ie. 

On Wednesday, 9th of September at 7pm, we’ll have a webinar where you can strengthen your citizen muscle. If you are on the zero waste/sustainable life journey for a while (or you just started), you may want to do something more, inspire change and make things happen in your community, town, country. We’ll have Grace Wilentz, an activist and lobbyist, giving a talk about how to do it! She’ll demystify the ‘speak to your TD’ task, will give practical examples, tips and advice to help you activate your citizen power. This talk will be given online via Zoom, link to be provided closer to the event. 

7pm on Thursday, 10th of September, sees a panel discussion over Zoom on ‘How to Stay Positive in Challenging Times’. The current global pandemic has caused much upheaval in most of our lives. For many of us we haven’t been able to be as sustainable as we would like due to personal circumstances, access to facilities, external guidelines as well as having to prioritise in our lives. In this panel discussion we speak to a diverse range of zero wasters on how they are coping, the compromises they are making and tips they have to keep positive in these times. We welcome questions to put to the panel submitted in advance to info@zerowastefestival.ie or in real time through the Zoom chat function. The Zoom link will be available on our website and social media closer to the date. 

Sunday, the 13th of September, sees us doing a litter pick, recycling rescue and asking brands to take responsibility at 2pm on Bull Island. Join us for a bit of fresh sea air doing a bit for the environment. In a group of 15 (following the current Covid-19 guidelines), we will be litter picking on the beautiful beaches of Bull Island, separating recyclables accordingly. In addition to that, we will identify the brands whose packaging we find and message them via social media to take responsibility! The spaces for this event are limited, so follow the link https://zww-litterpick.eventbrite.ie to sign up! 

On the day of the offline events, you will need to fill in contact tracing form and follow hygiene guidelines.

The links for the zoom events will be available soon on our website and social media.
