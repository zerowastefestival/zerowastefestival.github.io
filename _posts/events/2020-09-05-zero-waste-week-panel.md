On Wednesday, 9th of September at 7pm, we’ll have a webinar where you can strengthen your citizen muscle. If you are on the zero waste/sustainable life journey for a while (or you just started), you may want to do something more, inspire change and make things happen in your community, town, country. During the workshop ‘Zero Waste Advocacy - Bridging Personal Change and Societal Transformation’, we’ll have Grace Wilentz, an activist and lobbyist, giving a presentation about how to do it! She’ll demystify the ‘speak to your TD’ task, will give practical examples, tips and advice to help you activate your citizen power, followed by a Q&A.

This workshop will be given online via Zoom, please follow the link:
