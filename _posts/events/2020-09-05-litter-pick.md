![Zero Waste Week Litter Pick and Recycle Rescue in Bull Island](/events/2020-week-september/ZWW Litterpick.jpg)
Sunday, the 13th of September, sees us doing a litter pick, recycling rescue and asking brands to take responsibility at 2pm on Bull Island. Join us for a bit of fresh sea air doing a bit for the environment. In a group of 15 (following the current Covid-19 guidelines), we will be litter picking on the beautiful beaches of Bull Island, separating recyclables accordingly. In addition to that, we will identify the brands whose packaging we find and message them via social media to take responsibility! The spaces for this event are limited, so follow the link https://zww-litterpick.eventbrite.ie to sign up!
