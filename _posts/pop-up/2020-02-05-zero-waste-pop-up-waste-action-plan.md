The Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment is seeking input on the development of a new Waste Action Plan for Ireland. Now is the time to make our voices heard.

## What?

Do you agree that local recycling centres should provide more reuse opportunities, e.g. areas dedicated to exchange and upcycling? Do you think that reducing VAT for repair and reuse activities would be senseful? Should the government ban textiles from the general waste bin, landfill and incineration? Do you think there should be a ban on single-use cups?

For this pop-up event, the Zero Waste Festival Ireland team invited thought-leading panelists to discuss paths for Ireland to become a circular economy. After the discussion, we encourage you to send your own submission to the [Public Consultation Waste Action Plan for a Circular Economy](https://www.dccae.gov.ie/en-ie/environment/consultations/Pages/Public-Consultation-Waste-Action-Plan-for-a-Circular-Economy.aspx) and make your voice heard!

Our confirmed panelists include [Claire Downey (CRNI)](https://www.crni.ie/our-people/), [Laura Niessen (Rediscovery Centre)](http://www.rediscoverycentre.ie/about-us/our-team/), [Mindy O'Brien (VOICE)](https://voiceireland.org/) and [David Weitbrecht (zerowaste.ie)](https://www.zerowaste.ie/). The discussion will be hosted by [Elaine Butler (Living Lightly in Ireland)](https://livinglightlyinireland.wordpress.com/about/).

Elaine Butler is a sustainable living writer and speaker based in Dublin. She cuts through all the greenwashing out there to deliver simple, practical advice for anyone wanting to live more sustainably. She has been featured on national TV and in newspapers and given talks at numerous high-profile events. You'll find her on Facebook and Instagram or at https://livinglightlyinireland.wordpress.com/

Laura is a Research and Policy Officer at the Rediscovery Centre. She is an Environmental Scientist with expertise in interdisciplinary research with corporate and NGO sector experience. She currently works on research related to plastic recycling and assessing the reuse sector in Ireland, as well as circular economy policy. www.rediscoverycentre.ie

David is the founder of zerowaste.ie, an environmental start up. David's interest is the circular economy, particularly around business solutions to prevent waste before it occurs by encouraging reuse directly at source. The company's current focus is launching and operating a deposit return system for reusable food containers based on the underlying principles of the circular economy.

Mindy Oâ€™Brien is the Coordinator at VOICE of Irish Concern for the Environment, one of the leading organisations advocating for effective waste prevention policy and supporting a circular economy. She is an environmental attorney, and has been actively involved in environmental issues for over 25 years.

Past projects include the Recycling Ambassador Programme, Towards Zero Waste Cashel, Food Rescue and Feeding the 5,000 Dublin.

This event is organised by the Zero Waste Festival Ireland team as part of the 2020 spring series of pop-up events. 

This event is free to attend but any donations collected on the day will go directly to our speakers/facilitators in the form of a voucher to support local zero waste businesses as a token of our appreciation for their time. The Zero Waste Festival Ireland is a volunteer-run and community-led non-for-profit group aiming to facilitate zero waste networking, learning, and sharing in Ireland through a series of ongoing festivals, workshops, talks, screenings, and meet-up sessions at various locations.
